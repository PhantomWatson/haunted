    You slide open the glass door to the greenhouse and pause, noticing a soft, munching sound. You look around and
    notice the head of Abraham Lincoln on the ground. You note this strange fact and remember that if you happen upon
    the former president, to tell him that his head is <strong>in the greenhouse</strong>. A huge shadow before you
    moves slightly and you realize that a giant, man-eating turtle has noticed you. You bound over carnivorous plants
    and sand traps to escape before the ravenous reptile catches you.
