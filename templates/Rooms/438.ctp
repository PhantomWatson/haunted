    Dozens of Journalism-1 students are chained to desks in the journalism room and each is furiously scribbling away at
    reports and articles. Their teacher appears to be absent, but at her desk you see whips, chains, thumbscrews,
    and a big red "F" stamp. Before their teacher returns and mistakes you for an escaped student, you run back out
    into the hallway.
